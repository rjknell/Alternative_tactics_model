# Alternative_tactics_model
Model code and data files for an individual-based model of the effect of alternative reproductive tactics on adaptation and evolutionary rescue, coded in R.

Model developed by Rob Knell, University of Hull. r.j.knell@hull.ac.uk

The actual model is 'Alternative_tactics_model_fixed_groups.R'

The code for running sims and plotting graphs is sim_test_fixed_groups.R
NB don't just try to run this script it will take days because this has all the code for runnning all the simulations

The .csv files are output from running simulations.
