# Alternative_tactics_model
Model code and data files for an individual-based model of the effect of alternative reproductive tactics on adaptation and evolutionary rescue, coded in R.

Model developed by Rob Knell, University of Hull. r.j.knell@hull.ac.uk

The model code is 'Alternative_tactics_model.R'

The code for running sims and plotting graphs is 'ART_sims_and_analysis.R'
NB don't just try to run this script it will take days because this has all the code for runnning all the simulations

The .csv files are output from running simulations.
